THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE LINUX KERNEL HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

1. git clone linux v6.15 (JUST v6.15 not like v6.15.4 just straight up 6.15)
2. move that into a folder just called "linux" in the root directory of this repo
3. copy the config file in the root of this repo to linux/.config
4. youre good now just do ./build.sh to build and ./run.sh to run in qemu
